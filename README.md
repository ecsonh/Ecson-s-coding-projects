This #ecson-s-coding-project repository includes the class projects from UCI computer science class. All the work is done by myself in this repository. 

DG4M is a project that I worked on with a present UCI phD student. This project is to write a program for a wearable health device that can identify the current activity that the user is doing. In this project, I implemented machine learning models and data structuring functions using Python to build a program that analyzes the ongoing activities of the participants who wear the health device.

GDP is an Interactive Learning Platform that I collaborated with 4 other students in a computer science project course at UCI. I Implemented JavaScript and CSS to design the user interface and interactive features on a website for students to learn Geometry on 23 topics.

WebCrawler is a program that crawls through 4000+ of websites to retrieve keywords/numbers, filter out error pages, and index information to sort out useful information with Python.
